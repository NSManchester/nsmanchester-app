This is the Git repository for the open-source NSManchester app for iOS [available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nsmanchester/id1081057321?mt=8). Please send pull requests to contribute code and help crafting new features and awesome experiences.

This application is as much a learning project for using Swift as it is an _awesome_ application, so feel free to use whichever new fancy APIs or syntax you want. We're all here to learn!

## Coding Style

A consistent coding style is enforced by use of [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint). Please download and install the version specified in the [install_swiftlint.sh](install_swiftlint.sh) file and run before pushing changes to ensure that code consistency is maintained. The per-commit Travis CI build job will fail if linting rules are violated.

## License

NSManchester for iOS is released under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for details.
